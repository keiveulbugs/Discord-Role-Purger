# Discord-Role-Purger
A simple bot tool to kick users from a discord server based on their role with a single slash command.


For the bot to work, you will need to have a Discord bot secret which you can get on the developer page from Discord.

Discords role hierarchy also applies to bots. This means that if an user has a role higher in rank than the role the bot has, it can not kick the user.
